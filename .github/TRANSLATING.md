# Translating

Thank you for you interest in translating my cogs!

Unfortunately, I have not done a very good job creating my cogs in a way that makes adding translations easy.

Luckily for you, that isn't your problem! If the cog(s) for which you wish to contribute translations are not set up to
receive them, open a [new issue][tmerc-issue-feature] and I will take care of that part. As soon as I do, you may submit
translations!

Keep the following in mind with regard to translation pull requests:
1. I will not be fluent in the language to which you are translating. Please be patient with me as the review time may
   be quite long for this reason.
   - If you become a regular contributor of quality translations for a particular language, I will likely give you an
     assumption of correctness for work _in that language only_.
2. If you want to tackle the job of getting a cog ready to accept translations, and then _also_ translating, be my
   guest! Just make sure that calls to the translator are guarded from early execution.
   - But as I said above, this part doesn't need to be your problem, it can be mine!
